> 1. From a set of permutations for a given number n find the number of elements such hat no element appears in its original position.
<pre>
Input:
n = 4
Output: 9

Input:
n = 10
Output: 1334961
</pre>

> 2. Write a program to find partial sums of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

> 3. Given two long integers numbers min and max find and print a typical part n/d to such an extent that min<=d<=max and |n/d-pi| is negligible
if there are a few divisions having an insignificant distance to pi pick the one with the littlest denominator. 
<pre>
Input:
n = 1 10
Output: 22/7 

Explanation:- You must check all fractions with denominators from min to max.
</pre>

> 4. Given four points in the plane, write a program to check if they are the vertices of a rectangle.

> 5. Program to check if two rectangles, not necessarily aligned with the X and Y axes, intersect.

> 6. Program to swap bits with O(1) time complexity.

> 7. Calculate the area of a Circle inscribed in a Square.

> 8. A truck can transport a maximum of 10000 kgs. Assume a heap of load containing 41 boxes should be shipped through the truck. The box weight of this sort of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of 210 kgs 
and standard deviation of 15 kgs. What is the probability that all 41 boxes can be loaded into the truck and transported?

> 9. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

> 10. Write a program which have three numbers a, b, c where a < b < c and a^2 + b^2 = c^2. There exists only one solution where it satisfy the following equation for a+ b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.
