> 69. WAP that given a number n, the task is to find the even factor sum of a number.
<pre>
Input : 30

Even dividers sum 2 + 6 + 10 + 30 = 48
</pre>

> 70. WAP that given a number, find minimum sum of its factors.
<pre>
Input : 12
Output : 7
Explanation: 
Following are different ways to factorize 12 and
sum of factors in different ways.
12 = 12 * 1 = 12 + 1 = 13
12 = 2 * 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
12 = 3 * 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
12 = 2 * 2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
Therefore minimum sum is 7

> 71. Given an integer N, the task is to generate a matrix of dimensions N x N using positive integers from the range [1, N] such that the sum of the secondary diagonal is a prefect square
<pre>
Input: N = 7
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2 3 4 5 6 7 1
3 4 5 6 7 1 2

5 6 7 1 2 3 4
6 7 1 2 3 4 5
7 1 2 3 4 5 6
Explanation:
The sum of secondary diagonal = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9(= 3^2).

> 76. Maya celebrated her birthday party. After the completion of cake cutting ceremony, Maya’s mom cuts the cake into various pieces inorder to distribute it to all her friends.Given an integer n denoting the number of cuts that can be made on a birthday cake. Write a code to find the maximum number of pieces that can be formed by making n cuts.
<pre>
 Example :
 Input:  N = 6
 Output: 22
 Explanation: 22 pieces can be formed by making 6 cuts
</pre>

> 77. Given an array a[] of size n and a number num ,write a program to find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is num.
<pre>
Example:
Input: n = 6 , num = 78
a[ ] = { 5, 3, 2, 80, 20, 5 }
Output:1
Explanation: (2, 80) have difference of 78.
</pre>

> 78. Given an array a[ ]  of size n, swap the p th element from beginning with p th  element from end.
<pre>
Example:
Input: n = 8, p = 3 
a[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output: 1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8

Explanation: Binary representation of both numbers have same 0s and 1s
</pre>

> 81. Given an array of even size N, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced. An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half.
<pre>
Example:
Input:  n = 4 
a[ ] = { 1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Sum of right half of the array = 3 + 2 = 5
Sum of left half of the array = 1 + 5 = 6
To make the array balance we need to add 1
</pre>

> 82. Given a sorted array containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point. Note: return -1 if there is no transition point.
<pre>
Example: 
Input: n = 5
arr[ ] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the transition point from where 1 starts
Input : n = 4
arr[ ] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: -1
Explanation: -1 because there is no transition point
</pre>

> 83. Given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 
<pre>
Hint: Traverse all the elements from right to left in array and check whether the current element is greater than the maximum stored till now.
Example:
Input: n = 6
arr[ ] = { 16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}
Output: 17  5  2
